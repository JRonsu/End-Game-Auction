# End-Game-Auction
GA - Project 2

This project is a website where users can buy and sell their MMO accounts. The target audience is busy individuals who work 50-hour work weeks and have limited time to grind in-game, but still want to enjoy end-game content. The platform provides a marketplace for sellers to showcase their accounts' levels, silver available, and other important metrics, allowing buyers to quickly and easily find accounts that match their needs. The website is built using modern web technologies and is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. If you're looking to buy or sell MMO accounts, this is the place to be!
